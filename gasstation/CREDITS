Classes used:

com.falsepattern.gasstation.*

Modifications:

- Removed Mixin and MixinExtras bootstrap from GasStationCore.
- Disabled dev mixin plugin because UniMixins's Compat module does the same thing.
- Added call to "unimixins.mixinModidDecorator.refresh" after loading early mixins in GasStationCore and late mixins in LoadControllerMixin
- Added 1.8+ @Mod and @IFMLPlugin annotations
