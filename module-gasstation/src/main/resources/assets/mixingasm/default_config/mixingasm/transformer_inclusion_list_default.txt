# Mixingasm adds all transformers it doesn't "trust" to be Mixin-safe to the
# mixin environment's transformer exclusion list, avoiding running them an
# additional time when processing mixins at startup.

# This fixes issues that can arise from non-Mixin-aware transformers being run
# in that way. For example, some transformers break when run more than once.

# A transformer is considered "trusted" if one of these are true...
# * It's matched by a pattern in this file
# * It's matched by a pattern in transformer_inclusion_list.txt
# * It was added to Mixingasm's dynamic inclusion list by a mod using the API at startup
# * The transformer implements IMixinSafeTransformer
# AND the transformer is not matched by a pattern in transformer_exclusion_list.txt

# '*' can be used as a wildcard character.
